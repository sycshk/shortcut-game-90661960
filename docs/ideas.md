# Future Improvement Ideas for Elufa Systems Shortcut Game

This document tracks potential features and enhancements, focusing on organizational efficiency, professional skill development, and enterprise administration.

## 1. Professional Development & Workflow Efficiency
- **Role-Based Learning Paths:** Curated shortcut modules tailored to specific roles (e.g., "Financial Analyst" track focusing on Excel/Tagetik modeling, "Project Manager" track for Outlook/Teams efficiency).
- **Real-World Workflow Simulations:** Instead of isolated keystrokes, present multi-step business scenarios (e.g., "Open the monthly report, filter for 'Q4', and export to PDF") that require chaining correct shortcuts.
- **Productivity Analytics Dashboard:** A personal dashboard showing users their "Time Saved" ROI based on their improved shortcut speed (e.g., "You've saved approx. 2 hours this month by using shortcuts").
- **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** Professional-grade memory reinforcement to resurface missed shortcuts at optimal intervals, ensuring long-term retention of critical EPM tool knowledge.
- **Custom "Project" Loadouts:** Allow managers to create specific shortcut lists for upcoming projects (e.g., "Migration Project Essentials") to onboard teams quickly.

## 2. Access Control & Administration
- **Admin-Invite System:** Restrict registration to users invited by an Administrator via email, ensuring only authorized staff access the platform.
- **Corporate Domain Whitelisting:** Automatically approve registrations from specific email domains (e.g., `@elufa.com`) while requiring email verification (OTP/Link) to prevent unauthorized external access.
- **SSO Integration:** Integrate with Elufa Systems' Azure AD / Microsoft 365 for seamless Single Sign-On, enforcing corporate security policies.

## 3. User Self-Management
- **Profile Management:** Allow users to update their display name, avatar, and preferred role/department to receive relevant content recommendations.
- **Progress Reset & Data Control:** Options for users to reset their progress on specific modules to retrain from scratch, or download their learning history certificate.
- **Notification Preferences:** User controls for email summaries (weekly progress reports) or browser notifications for Daily Challenges.

## 4. Content & Knowledge ROI
- **"Pro-Tip" Context:** Display "Why Use It?" tips explaining the efficiency gain (e.g., "Use Ctrl+D to copy formulas down 1000 rows instantly vs. dragging manually").
- **Integration with EPM Documentation:** Direct links to official documentation for Workday Adaptive/Oracle within the quiz context to deepen understanding.
- **Staff Contribution Portal:** Allow senior consultants to suggest new, niche shortcuts discovered during implementations to be added to the company knowledge base.
